What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?  \n","# --> Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line, while compiled languages translate code into machine code before execution.\n","\n","# 2. What is exception handling in Python?  \n","# --> Exception handling allows the program to handle runtime errors gracefully using try, except, and finally blocks.\n","\n","# 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?  \n","# --> The finally block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.\n","\n","# 4. What is logging in Python?  \n","# --> Logging is a way to track events that happen during the execution of a program for debugging or monitoring.\n","\n","# 5. What is the significance of the _del_ method in Python?  \n","# --> The _del_ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed, allowing cleanup actions.\n","\n","# 6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?  \n","# --> import imports the entire module, while from ... import imports specific components from a module.\n","\n","# 7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?  \n","# --> Use a single except block with a tuple of exceptions or multiple except blocks for different exceptions.\n","\n","# 8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?  \n","# --> The with statement ensures that files are properly closed after operations, even if exceptions occur.\n","\n","# 9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?  \n","# --> Multithreading uses threads within a single process, while multiprocessing uses multiple processes with separate memory.\n","\n","# 10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?  \n","# --> Logging helps debug, monitor, and track errors or performance issues during program execution.\n","\n","# 11. What is memory management in Python?  \n","# --> Python handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically using its garbage collection system.\n","\n","# 12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?  \n","# --> Surround risky code with try, handle exceptions in except, execute necessary code in finally or else.\n","\n","# 13. Why is memory management important in Python?  \n","# --> Proper memory management ensures efficient use of resources and prevents memory leaks.\n","\n","# 14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?  \n","# --> The try block contains code that may raise an exception, and the except block handles the exception.\n","\n","# 15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?  \n","# --> Python's garbage collector automatically deallocates memory by identifying and cleaning up unused objects.\n","\n","# 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?  \n","# --> The else block executes code if no exception occurs in the try block.\n","\n","# 17. What are the common logging levels in Python?  \n","# --> Common logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n","\n","# 18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?  \n","# --> os.fork() creates a new process directly, while multiprocessing provides a higher-level API for process management.\n","\n","# 19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?  \n","# --> Closing a file ensures that data is saved and resources are released.\n","\n","# 20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?  \n","# --> file.read() reads the entire file, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n","\n","# 21. What is the logging module in Python used for?  \n","# --> The logging module is used to create log messages for debugging or monitoring program execution.\n","\n","# 22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?  \n","# --> The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as handling file paths and directories.\n","\n","# 23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?  \n","# --> Challenges include managing circular references and optimizing memory usage for large data.\n","\n","# 24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?  \n","# --> Use the raise keyword followed by the exception, e.g., raise ValueError(\"An error occurred\").\n","\n","# 25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?  \n","# --> Multithreading improves performance in I/O-bound tasks by running multiple threadsÂ concurrently.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"gR4lGOIwcYg5"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# practical questions"],"metadata":{"id":"hp2mV2qRcgL4"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"s8mPD8KTafea","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742321547056,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Sagar Kr.","userId":"11173499864920038829"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# 1.
